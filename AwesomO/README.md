To build the project, the following requirements are neccesary:
- JDK 1.8
- NetBeans 8.0.2 
- JUnit 4.x (optional in the NetBeans installer)
- Apache Ant (also included in NetBeans)

Source code is located in ./src

Unit tests are located in ./tests and can be executed and edited from within NetBeans, using the JUnit framework.

The build scripts are located in ./build; debug.xml for debug builds and release.xml for release builds.

These scripts require Apache Ant, which is also included in NetBeans out of the box.

This means no commands are needed to build/test/deploy.

In order to test our implementation, run the 'CoffeeTest.java' or the 'DoorbellTest.java' in netbeans located in tests --> core 

<!---
To specify:

Any further instructions needed to configure a fresh install of the IDE such that it can compile/build/deploy/test/run your implementation.

The actual compile/build/deploy/test commands to use.
